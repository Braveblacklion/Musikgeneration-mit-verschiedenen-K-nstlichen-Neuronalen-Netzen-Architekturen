## Tensorflow

This branch uses standalone Keras with a Tensorflow 1.14 backend.

## Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

The notebooks for each chapter are in the root of the repository, prefixed with the chapter number.

The `data` folder is where to download relevant data sources (chapter 3 onwards)
The `run` folder stores output from the generative models (chapter 3 onwards)
The `utils` folder stores useful functions that are sourced by the main notebooks


## Getting started

To get started, first install the required libraries inside a virtual environment:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
